# ExoPlayer
We can play videos by using MediaPlayer and VideoPlayer. But there is a problem while playing the video like white screen and buffering problems.
By using this ExoPlayer we can overcome the above problems.
Firstly to access this in our application we have to add dependencies in our application for supporting ExoPlayer.
It helps for smooth running of the video.
And this is the basic application for implimenting the video in our application.
