# ExoPlayer :blush:
We can play videos by using MediaPlayer and VideoPlayer. But there is a problem while playing the video like white screen and buffering problems :thumbsdown:.
By using this ExoPlayer we can overcome the above problems :thumbsup: :blush:.
Firstly to access this in our application we have to add dependencies in our application for supporting ExoPlayer.
It helps for smooth running of the video :raised_hands:.
And this is the basic application for implementing the video in our application :thumbsup:.
It is very easy to understand and to implement.
